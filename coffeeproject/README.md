<h1 align="center"> Coffee Review Project(In Progress) </h1>

## Overview
As an avid coffee drinker, I was excitied to see a data set on Kaggle with Reviews associate to coffee types and brands. I noticied the data set was scraped from the [Coffee Review Site](https://www.coffeereview.com) and started reviewing the details. 

Majority of the time was cleaning the data and updating details to make the data more manageable. Such as nulls, formatting, and missing data. After completing the data clean up, I created a view to start looking into my next batch of coffee to try next!
