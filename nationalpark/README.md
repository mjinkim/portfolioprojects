# California Forecasting Dashboard.

## Summary
The inital question that started this project was, "Can I attempt to forecast how busy a national park might be for next year? I wanted to see if we could forecast visitation to national parks in California to get some what of an idea on how busy each month might be. <br>

I purchased my first [America the Beautiful National Park](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm) card this year and enjoyed every moment I had with it. I live in San Diego and we have a national moument that is close by, we also visted Joshua Tree and Yoesemite Twice this year. So the question began, can I see past yearly vists and forecast what we might expect next year and put this in a dashboard. 

## [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CaliforniaNP/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- Contains sum of last years vists in 2021 for NPS data in Califonia.
- Contains sun of this years visits as of December 2022. Pending the data for this month to also add.
- Contains the 2023 Forecast visits for all Califonia national parks including a forecase of December 2022(not avaialbe when creating dashboard)
- Contains a state map of all locations. 

## Future Plan
- I would like to compare the forecasted month of Decembmer with actual data once avaiable 
- Attempt to create another dashboard with all state national parks with the NPS data
- Exploring data for more specific treads. (In progress)
