<h1 align="center"> Umpire Accuracy Exploratory Project (In Progress) </h1>

## Purpose
As an avid baseball fan, Go Dodgers!, I wanted to expolore some statistical data for umpires behind the plate. I used data on Kaggle from the [UmpScoreCard](https://umpscorecards.com/) and explored into the data to see if any recent MLB rule changes have impacted the overall performance of umpire calls. A great way to improve my querying skills, at the same time review some baseball data. 

## Interesting Findings
### High and Low Accuracy Games
- 1 Perfect game with a 100% accuracy
- 32 Total games that were above or equal to 99% accuracy. (19 in 2022 and 14 for all years before)
- 183 Total games below or equal to 85% accuracy. (Large Majority are before 2020)

### Yearly Metrics
- Starting in 2019 we start to see an increase in overall accuracy and a drop in incorrect calls. 
- 2022 Playoff Statics were the best for the data points captured
- 2017 Season had a sudden increase in accuracy and drop in incorrect calls when compared to 2 year before and after. 

### Does Home Field also Impact Umpires (Theory) 
- For the total data we see 9753 wins for Home Teams and 8459 Away Teams
- We see generally the away team on average has a higher number of incorrect calls and correct calls. Accuracy remains the same. 
- Games with a 1 score difference we see the away team reciving on average 12.00 incorrect calls to 11.59 for the home team and 146.16 correct calls to 141.65 for the home team.
- Games with both teams scoring more than 10 runs saw the same story. With the away team reciving on average 14.27 incorrect calls to 13.56 and 193.07 to 180.00.
